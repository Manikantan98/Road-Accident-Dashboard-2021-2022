## Requirements
The Road Accident Dashboard provides insights into various aspects of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard addresses the following key requirements:

### Primary KPIs

Additionally, it identifies the year with the highest number of casualties in each severity category.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Analyzes the distribution of casualties across different vehicle types (car, motorcycle, truck, etc.) for both years.
- **Monthly Trend Comparison:** Compares the monthly trends in casualties between 2021 and 2022, allowing for identification of seasonal patterns or fluctuations.
- **Maximum Casualties by Road Type:** Pinpoints the types of roads (highway, urban street, rural road) with the highest number of casualties in both years.
- **Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface:** Explores the distribution of casualties across various road surface conditions (wet, dry, icy, etc.) for both years.
- **Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night:** Investigates the correlation between the location or area of accidents and the time of day (day or night) when they occurred, providing insights into potential risk factors.
